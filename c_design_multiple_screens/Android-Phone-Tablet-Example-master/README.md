Optimizing for Android Phones and Tablets Example
------

An example Android application to demonstrate optimizing the user interface for phones and tablets. This is a code example created for my blog post, [Android Tutorial: Optimizing for Phones and Tablets with Fragments](http://blogs.captechconsulting.com/blog/steven-byle/android-tutorial-optimizing-phones-and-tablets-fragments), which explains the topic of <code>Fragments</code> and creating reusable, flexible user interfaces in depth. This project has a minimum requirement of Android 3.0 (API 11), in order to support 3D view rotations. However, the [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html) supports back to Android 1.6 (API 4) and allows for <code>Fragment</code> based applications.
